# Analysis of the Quarterly Fishery Surveys - Salton Sea From 2003 To 2008

## üìä Project Overview

This project is a personal exploration of quantitative conservation management using publicly available data from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). The primary goals are to visualize and analyze fish population data from the Salton Sea to understand species trends, habitat use, and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE). This work is meant for learning, data visualization, and sharing insights ‚Äî not for official reporting.

‚∏ª

## üéØ Goals of the Analysis
	1.	Track population changes over time for each fish species.
	2.	Identify habitat types where each species is most abundant.
	3.	Calculate overall and species-specific CPUE.
	4.	Visualize fish abundance data spatially across different sampling sites.

## üåä Background: The Salton Sea & Monitoring Program

The Salton Sea is California‚Äôs largest inland waterbody, vital to fish populations and migratory birds on the Pacific Flyway. However, the ecosystem is under stress due to declining water levels, increasing salinity, and reduced inflows, impacting both wildlife and air quality.

In response, the CDFW initiated a long-term fish monitoring program in 2003, sampling 14 stations quarterly across three habitat types: pelagic (open water), near-shore, and estuarine zones. Sampling is conducted with gill nets deployed for approximately 24 hours per site, with fish identified, counted, and measured for key biological indicators (length, weight, sex, condition, etc.).

## Key Notes:
	‚Ä¢	Some seasonal data are missing (e.g., Fall and Winter 2007) due to launch site inaccessibility.
	‚Ä¢	Initial deep-water sites were eliminated after year one due to zero catch results.
	‚Ä¢	Sampling dates can vary; seasonal boundaries may not align cleanly with calendar months.
	‚Ä¢	Anomalous data (e.g., Oct 13, 2004) were re-sampled due to extreme weather-driven changes.
	‚Ä¢	The primary goal of data collection is to monitor presence/absence and trends in fish populations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Considerations
	‚Ä¢	CPUE calculations and fish abundance data may contain outliers or missing entries due to weather or equipment issues.
	‚Ä¢	Data should be interpreted with the context of biological and environmental variability in mind.
	‚Ä¢	This dataset complements the Quarterly Water Quality Surveys - Salton Sea [ds429].
